# conference-tools
The file compute_bai.py aims to computing statistics about bidding behavior in one conference, so that 
the output can be aggregated.  The tool is written for processing data files generated by hotcrp. 

For each submission cycle, the tool needs two csv files, one listing authors of submissions, and the other 
giving the bidding preferences of PC members.  All cycles for one conferences can be processed in one run. 
Paths to the data files should be specified by modifying the code in the main function.

The command argument specifies the output file name.  Each row in the output csv file corresponds to one
pair of <PC member P, author A> and contains the following fields:
row[0]: # of submissions by A that P bids significantly positively (defined to be >= 5 for now)
row[1]: total bidding scores for these biddings 
row[2]: total # of submissions that P bids significantly positively
row[3]: total sum of P's significantly positive bidding preference scores
row[4]: email of P
row[5]: full name of P
row[6]: email of A
row[7]: full name of A
row[8]: total number of submissions by A
